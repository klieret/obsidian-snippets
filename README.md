# Snippets for Obsidian

This is a collection of the snippets that I use for [Obsidian][obsidian].
Some of them are contributed by various people and are credited in comments
on top of the file.

## Overview of the snippets

- `all-caps-internal-links.css`: Display internal links in all caps. This was
  originally a design feature by the [Sanctum][sanctum] theme, but got dropped in
  newer releases
- `clean-embeds-all.css`: Make embeds blend into notes (Removes title, link, padding, 
  margins from embeds, so they really look like the same note). This code is from
  Matthias C. Hormann.
- `disable_strikethrough_checkbox.css`: Disable strikethrough for ticked checkboxes
  (authors are [mxmossy][] and [conname][])
- `highlight-bold-darkmode.css`: Highlight bold darkmode: Bold text in dark mode doesn't stand out very much, so
  this snippets makes it underlined and all-caps.
- `justified.css`: Justify all text in obsidian
