# Snippets for Obsidian

This is a collection of the snippets that I use for [Obsidian][obsidian].
Some of them are contributed by various people and are credited in comments
on top of the file.

## Overview of the snippets

- Display internal links in all caps. This was
  originally a design feature by the [Sanctum][sanctum] theme, but got dropped in
  newer releases
- Make embeds blend into notes
- Disable strikethrough for ticked checkboxes
- Highlight bold darkmode: Bold text in dark mode doesn't stand out very much, so
  this snippets makes it underlined and all-caps.
- Justify all text in obsidian
